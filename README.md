## About me

Having completed the intensive Data Analytics Bootcamp at Juno College I have the technical skills outlined in the job description. In order to demonstrate the skills I developed I worked on several projects, some collaboratively and others independently, which use a combination of Python, SQL, Tableau and Excel/Google Sheets to draw significant insights and evaluations into a given dataset. Windows functions in SQL and the Pandas, NumPy, SciKit Learn, Python libraries are some of the tools present in these projects.

Having past experience as an executive trainee and graduating as a civil engineer there are transferable skills you are looking for problem solving, and the ability to communicate at a variety of levels. My degree in Civil Engineering taught me more then just the physics behind a structure, it taught me how to look at a situation from a variety of angles in order to determine the best course of action.
